				My favorite animal is a giraffe. Which is funny because I do not particularly believe in giraffes. I mean, what sound does a giraffe make? A cow goes "Moo", a dog goes "Bark", and a giraffe says... "..". I just dont buy it, i just dont.. buy it.

				Having a favorite animal that is in fact a figment of my imagination is strage, but it's a lifestyle, honestly. It's something I chose to do from a young age and It's just become part of normal life. All praise the tree...with ears...
